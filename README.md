# Latent-ODE

This repo includes two experiments on toy dataset described in the paper:

- For ODE-RNN in interpolation task, see ./ODE_RNN
- For Latent ODE in extrapolation task, see ./Latent_ODE

To test the code:
- Install prerequisite ODE Solver at https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq
- Run `$ python3 toy.py`
- Check the generated figures in ./fig and ./test_fig
